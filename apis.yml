      Zluri is a SaaS management and operations platform that helps
      organizations discover, govern, and optimize all their cloud applications.
      By connecting to SSO, finance, HR systems, and app APIs, it builds a
      unified system of record for SaaS usage, users, licenses, and spend. IT,
      finance, and procurement teams use Zluri to surface shadow IT, eliminate
      redundant or underused tools, rightsize licenses, and manage renewals and
      vendor relationships. It also automates user lifecycle tasks—like
      onboarding, role changes, and offboarding—while enforcing access,
      security, and compliance policies. The result is lower SaaS spend, reduced
      risk, and smoother day‑to‑day SaaS operations.
